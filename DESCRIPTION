Description: Conversion of characters from unsupported Vietnamese character encodings to Unicode characters. These Vietnamese encodings (TCVN3, VISCII, VPS) are not natively supported in R and lead to printing of wrong characters and garbled text (mojibake). This package fixes that problem and provides readable output with the correct Unicode characters (with or without diacritics).
